This program is a simple web application designed to save and manage a list of URLs, such as web links that a user might find useful and want to revisit later. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the following key functionalities:

1. **Saving Input URLs**:
   - Users can enter a URL into a text input field and click the "SAVE INPUT" button to save it.
   - The entered URL is then added to a list and displayed on the page.
   - The saved URLs are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.

2. **Saving the Current Tab URL**:
   - By clicking the "SAVE TAB" button, users can save the URL of the currently active browser tab.
   - This feature uses the Chrome extension API (`chrome.tabs.query`) to fetch the active tab's URL and store it.

3. **Displaying Saved URLs**:
   - The saved URLs are displayed in an unordered list (`<ul>`).
   - Each URL is rendered as a clickable link that opens in a new tab (`<a target='_blank'>`).

4. **Deleting All Saved URLs**:
   - Users can delete all saved URLs by double-clicking the "DELETE ALL" button.
   - This clears the local storage and the displayed list.

### Detailed Breakdown of the Code:

- **HTML Structure**:
  - The HTML file contains the structure of the web page, including the input field, buttons, and an unordered list to display the saved URLs.
  - The CSS file (`index.css`) is linked in the head to style the page.
  - The JavaScript file (`index.js`) is linked at the end to add functionality.

- **JavaScript Functionality**:
  - Variables and DOM Elements:
    - `myLeads`: An array to store the URLs.
    - `inputEl`: The text input element where users enter URLs.
    - `inputBtn`: The button to save the input URL.
    - `ulEl`: The unordered list element to display URLs.
    - `deleteBtn`: The button to delete all URLs.
    - `tabBtn`: The button to save the current tab's URL.
    - `leadsFromLocalStorage`: Retrieves URLs from local storage if they exist.
  - Event Listeners:
    - `inputBtn` click: Saves the URL entered in the input field.
    - `tabBtn` click: Saves the current tab's URL using the Chrome extension API.
    - `deleteBtn` double-click: Clears all saved URLs.
  - `render` Function:
    - Renders the list of saved URLs on the page.
    - Creates a list item (`<li>`) for each URL and wraps it in a clickable link (`<a>`).
    - Updates the inner HTML of the unordered list (`ulEl.innerHTML`).

Overall, this program provides a convenient way to save, view, and manage a list of URLs directly from a web page, leveraging local storage to persist data across sessions.
